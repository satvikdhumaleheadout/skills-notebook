## [v1.0] — 2026-04-27 — Initial release

**Summary:** First versioned release of the CVR-RCA skill. Establishes the full investigation framework, reference files, SQL pipeline, rendering helpers, and evaluation rubric.

### What's included

**Core skill (`SKILL.md`)**
- Full 4-step investigation framework: baseline pipeline → investigation → report → self-evaluation
- Three mandatory pre-investigation questions: routing vs conversion (Q1), primary Shapley driver (Q2), sudden vs gradual onset (Q3)
- Worked example showing both a mix-dominant path and a funnel-conversion path
- Investigation transcript requirement (`transcript.md`) — every decision fork logged with hypothesis, data, decision, and ruled-out paths
- Custom query patterns for all available dimensions (`browsing_country`, `channel_name`, `lead_time_days`, `page_sub_type`, `previous_page_url`, cross-dimensional cuts)
- Mixpanel session recording integration for URL-level qualitative confirmation

**Reference files (`references/`)**
- `context.md` — full business domain vocabulary, table schemas (`mixpanel_user_page_funnel_progression`, `product_rankings_features`, `dim_combined_entities`, `dim_experiences`), column-level notes, counting rules, and analytical definitions
- `hypothesis.md` — 10 historical patterns drawn from 21 Headout MMPs, ranked by frequency across LP2S/S2C/C2O/mix scenarios; framed as priors to orient (not constrain) hypothesis generation
- `actions.md` — 10 root-cause-to-action mappings with DRI, priority, and historical references from real Headout RCAs
- `report_structure.md` — fixed three-section layout (Executive Summary → Actions → Supporting Analysis) with hard constraints, anti-pattern list, and length calibration table

**SQL pipeline (`references/`)**
- `q0_meta.sql` — CE name and top page URL
- `q1_base.sql` — base funnel by MB/HO × Channel × Period with CE-level ALL row
- `q2_dimensions.sql` — device, language, page_type cuts
- `q3_trend.sql` — daily CVR trend for pre and post periods
- `q4_experience.sql` — experience-level S2C and CVR breakdown
- `q5_price.sql` — price analysis (final vs original price, median, pre/post comparison)
- `q6_urls.sql` — top 20 page URLs by LP traffic volume with per-URL funnel rates

**Scripts (`scripts/`)**
- `run_analysis.sh` — orchestrates Q0–Q6, runs Q2–Q6 in parallel, produces `summary.json`
- `aggregate.py` — computes Shapley decomposition, mix vs conversion effects, C2O sub-decomposition, rolls up all stage JSON into structured `summary.json`
- `render.py` — HTML component helpers: metric cards, trend charts, experience tables
- `helpers.py` — shared utilities

**Report template (`templates/`)**
- `report.html` — base HTML template for rendered reports

**Evaluation rubric (`evals/`)**
- `evaluator.md` — 7-theme rubric (Narrative Coherence, Hypothesis Specificity, Investigation Effort, Branch Decision Quality, Evidence Strength, Output Appropriateness, DRI Actionability) scored 1–5 with evaluation file format
- `evals/runs/` — persistent record of past evaluations (accumulates across runs)

## [v1.1] — 2026-04-27 — Process/domain separation

**Summary:** The skill was refactored to enforce a clean separation between *process* (what steps to follow and when to pivot) and *domain knowledge* (how to interpret data, what patterns to look for, how to write queries). `SKILL.md` is now a lean process orchestrator. `context.md` is the domain knowledge hub. A new `worked_example.md` file houses the two end-to-end investigation walkthroughs.

This makes the skill easier to maintain: process changes update `SKILL.md`, analytical guidance updates `context.md`, and neither bleeds into the other.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c003 → c007)
- **c003:** Added majority-contributor principle (focus on entities with meaningful CE traffic share, not long-tail noise) and rate × volume rule (impact = rate delta × user volume, not rate delta alone). Strengthened session recordings from optional to required once a locus is confirmed; skipping must be explicitly justified in the report.
- **c004:** Fixed session recordings trigger from conjunctive (URL *and* experience *and* segment) to disjunctive (any concentrated dimension cut is sufficient). Added "Data pull errors — log and continue" section: query failures are logged in the transcript and noted in the report as data gaps; the investigation does not halt.
- **c005:** Updated report visual standard; added P1/P2/P3 priority badges to action cards.
- **c006:** Removed references to Q2/Q4/Q5/Q6 as pre-built templates to run; fixed stale `summary.json` field references in investigation patterns. All custom querying is now framed as write-from-scratch using `context.md` schemas.
- **c007:** Stripped `SKILL.md` to pure process orchestration. All domain content moved out:
  - Query rules, dimension guidance, investigation patterns per funnel step → `context.md`
  - Both worked examples → `references/worked_example.md`
  - Q3 (onset type) expanded from two branches to three (sudden / gradual / seasonal); full interpretation guide lives in `context.md`

**`references/context.md`** (c002)
- Added **Query Principles** section: majority-contributor principle and rate × volume rule (moved from SKILL.md, formalized as domain rules)
- Added **Q3 Trend Interpretation** guide: how to read each 90-day trend shape (sharp break / gradual erosion / recovery in progress), how to use the LY overlay and `structural_delta_cvr` to calibrate investigation depth, and weekday composition check
- Added **Dimensions to Query and When**: `browsing_country`, `browsing_city`, `channel_name`, `lead_time_days`, `page_sub_type`, `previous_page_url`, cross-dimensional cuts, experience-level with availability proxy — each with the hypothesis context that makes it worth querying
- Added **Common Investigation Patterns**: per-funnel-step query angles for mix, LP2S, S2C, and C2O drivers (moved from SKILL.md, expanded)
- Added **Session Recordings** guidance: structured table format (Recording | Steps observed | Inference) rather than prose; inference column must state what each recording proves or rules out

**`references/worked_example.md`** (new file)
- Two complete end-to-end investigation walkthroughs extracted from `SKILL.md`:
  - **Example 1:** Mix-dominant story — MB traffic share shift explains the CVR drop; no funnel step broke; report covers mix table and URL traffic comparison only
  - **Example 2:** Conversion-dominant, concentrated locus — S2C drop, sharp Apr 8 onset, French × iOS Mweb cross-cut, session recordings confirming empty date picker; shows how the investigation narrows from CE-wide to one experience on one locale

## [v1.2] — 2026-04-27 — Default analysis window changed to 30 days

**Summary:** The skill previously required explicit date arguments every time it was invoked. Dates are now optional — when omitted, the script automatically uses the last 30 days as the post period and the 30 days before that as the pre period. This removes the most common friction point when starting a quick investigation.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c009)
- Invocation syntax updated from required `<pre_start> <pre_end> <post_start> <post_end>` to optional `[<pre_start> <pre_end> <post_start> <post_end>]`
- Added one-line note explaining the default: last 30 days = post, prior 30 days = pre

**`scripts/run_analysis.sh`** (c002)
- Date arguments are now optional. When not supplied, the script computes: `POST_END` = yesterday, `POST_START` = 30 days ago, `PRE_END` = 31 days ago, `PRE_START` = 61 days ago
- Added cross-platform `_date_offset()` helper that works on both BSD `date` (macOS) and GNU `date` (Linux)
- Script now prints the resolved date windows at the end of every run so it is always visible which periods were used
- Cleaned up header comments: removed stale Q2/Q4/Q5/Q6 "demoted" note that no longer applies

---

## [v1.3] — 2026-04-28 — Investigation tree model + unified run folder

**Summary:** Two significant upgrades in this release. First, the investigation model was rewritten from a sequential three-question gate into a parallel investigation tree (L0 → L1 → leaf), making the analytical reasoning faster and more structured. Second, all run outputs (report, transcript, evaluation, findings, raw data) are now consolidated into a single persistent folder per run, with date-range naming and auto-increment to prevent overwrites.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c012 → c016)
- **c012 — Investigation tree model:** Replaces the sequential Q1/Q2/Q3 gate model with a tree structure. L0 reads all three orientation signals simultaneously (`mix_dominance`, `shapley`, `trend_context`). L1 opens a parallel hypothesis batch based on L0 signals. Each result either confirms (open L2), rules out (close branch), or concentrates (anchor all downstream queries). Investigation terminates at a leaf: a specific mechanism × segment/experience/URL × date. Transcript format mirrors the tree with `## L0`, `## L1`, `## L2`, and `## Root cause confirmed` sections.
- **c013 — Tree map in transcript:** Transcript now has two layers — a tree map block at the top showing the full branch structure (`CONFIRMED / RULED OUT / OPEN / LEAF` per branch) and detail sections below with query results. Tree map is written after L0 with all L1 branches marked `OPEN` and updated as results arrive. Anyone reading the transcript sees the investigation shape immediately without scrolling.
- **c014 — Date range in output directory name:** Output folder renamed from `/tmp/cvr_rca_<ce_id>/` to include the date range (e.g. `ce167_2026-03-01_2026-04-29/`). Running the same CE twice with different windows no longer silently overwrites results.
- **c015 — Consolidated run folder:** All outputs for a run now live in one persistent folder: `~/Documents/RCA skill/Test Runs/ce<ce_id>_<pre_start>_<post_end>/`. Previously, outputs were scattered across `/tmp/`, `~/Documents/RCA skill/transcripts/`, and `~/Documents/RCA skill/evals/`. Report, transcript, evaluation, findings, and raw pipeline data are all co-located.
- **c016 — Auto-increment on folder collision:** If the named run folder already exists (same CE + same dates run twice), the script auto-increments the suffix: `_run2/`, `_run3/`, etc. The chosen folder name is printed at the start of the run. SKILL.md now uses `<run_dir>` shorthand throughout so the naming logic is explained once in Step 1 and not repeated.

**`references/context.md`**
- Added **"Investigation tree — L0 to L1 branch map"** section: a lookup table mapping each combination of L0 signals (mix dominant / LP2S primary / S2C primary / C2O primary / gradual / sudden) to the default set of L1 branches that should open. Removes the need to derive the branch set from first principles on every run.

**`references/worked_example.md`**
- Both examples (mix-dominant and conversion-dominant) rewritten with tree-format transcripts: parallel query batches made explicit, session recordings anchored to L2 leaf, tree map blocks included showing branch resolution.

**`scripts/run_analysis.sh`**
- Output directory updated to `~/Documents/RCA skill/Test Runs/ce<ce_id>_<pre_start>_<post_end>/`
- Auto-increment logic added for folder collisions
- Prints resolved run folder name at start of execution

**`scripts/aggregate.py`**
- Docstring example updated to reflect new output directory pattern

**Removed**
- `assets/headout-logo.svg` — unused since `render.py` was removed in a prior release
- `templates/report copy.html` — stale duplicate, superseded by `templates/report.html`

## [v1.4] — 2026-04-29 — Mix cascade, self-extending branches, hypothesis.md restructure

**Summary:** Three interlocking upgrades that make the investigation more rigorous and faster to execute. First, the mix cascade is now a mandatory L1 step that runs before any funnel hypothesis — it fixes the primary segment (MB/HO → Paid/Organic → Channel) so all downstream funnel analysis describes a homogeneous cohort. Second, hypothesis generation is now explicitly self-extending: branches grow level-by-level from what the data shows, not from a pre-written list, and a new "Surprises" result type forces investigation of unexpected findings. Third, `hypothesis.md` is restructured as the central branch reference for the entire investigation — it now owns both the L0 routing map and the first-pass branch sets (moved from `context.md`), keeping `context.md` focused on business vocabulary, schemas, and query rules only.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c017 → c020)
- **c017 — Mix cascade as mandatory L1:** Before forming any funnel hypothesis, run a three-level mix cascade (Level 1: MB vs HO from `summary.json`; Level 2: Paid vs Organic custom BQ query; Level 3: Channel breakdown within Paid). Fixed segment declared once in the transcript; all L2+ queries carry that segment's filters. L1 and L2+ step names updated accordingly.
- **c018 — Self-extending hypothesis loop:** L2+ branches grow from what the data shows, not from a fixed upfront list. Four result types formalised: Confirms, Rules out, Concentrates, and Surprises. "Surprises" is new — an unexpected result generates a new branch even if it wasn't in the default set. Investigation ends at the leaf, not at list exhaustion.
- **c019 — Remove stale artifact:** Removed "write 2–4 specific, falsifiable hypotheses" from L2+ — a leftover from the old Q1/Q2/Q3 model that contradicted the tree structure.
- **c020 — File role descriptions updated:** `context.md` role narrowed to business vocabulary, schemas, and query rules. `hypothesis.md` described as the two-level central branch reference (L0 routing + first-pass branch sets + historical patterns). L2+ pointer updated from `context.md` → `hypothesis.md`.

**`references/context.md`** (c004 → c009)
- **c004/c005 — Inventory table schemas:** Added `analytics_reporting.inventory_availability` and `analytics_intermediate.inventory_changes` with full column-level notes, join path (the two-hop `dim_experiences → dim_tours → inventory_availability` bridge), and lead-time bucket query. Bucket boundaries carry inline guidance to adapt to each CE's booking horizon. Results interpretation covers both window-specific and uniform-decline patterns.
- **c006 — Mix Cascade section:** Full three-level cascade added with BQ query templates for Level 2 (Paid/Organic) and Level 3 (Channel breakdown within Paid), decision rule for when to fix a level (>15% post share + dominant checkout impact), and fixed segment declaration template with filter strings.
- **c007 — Investigation patterns expanded:** LP2S gains three-tier triage (dimension cuts → pricing if no concentration → sessions as fallback). S2C gains language × S2C and device × S2C as first-pass cuts before experience-level; inventory lead-time bucket query integrated into S2C path. C2O expanded with four C2A hypotheses (pax availability, price friction, UX change, sessions) and three A2O hypotheses (gateway failure, fraud tightening, live inventory sync failure) with named DRIs.
- **c008 — Common Investigation Patterns header rewritten:** "Not rails" disclaimer replaced with explicit loop logic — patterns are the default starting set, results generate the next hypothesis, investigation ends at the leaf not at list exhaustion. Three reasons a list runs out before a leaf is reached added.
- **c009 — Moved investigation logic to hypothesis.md:** "Investigation tree — L0 to L1 branch map" and "Common Investigation Patterns" sections removed from `context.md` and moved to `hypothesis.md`.

**`references/hypothesis.md`** (c004)
- **c004 — Restructured as two-level branch reference:** Level 1 (L0 routing map + first-pass branch sets by funnel step) added at the top, moved from `context.md`. Level 2 (historical patterns 1–10) retained and explicitly labelled as "mechanism detail by scenario" — used once a first-pass branch confirms a direction. "How to use this file" updated to reflect full role as the central branch reference for all investigation levels.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c006 → c010)
- **c006/c007 — Positive CVR framing:** New green-border callout variant for CVR-improvement investigations: heading "CVR Improved — What's Driving It & What's Holding It Back" with three questions (What drove the improvement? What's holding it back? When did the headwind emerge?).
- **c008 — 90-day chart to Section 1:** Chart moves from Section 3 (conditional) to Section 1 (always), appearing after metric cards and before the root cause callout. Post-window shade is green for improvements, red for declines.
- **c009 — Fixed Segment banner:** New HTML component after mix cascade output, before Shapley block. Declares `MB/HO · Paid/Organic · Channel` scope for all downstream funnel analysis.
- **c010 — Raw user counts mandatory:** All tables showing rates or shares must include Pre Users and Post Users columns. "Table shows rates/shares with no user counts" added to anti-patterns list.

## [v1.5] — 2026-05-04 — Findings synthesis gate + Evaluator failure mode classification

**Summary:** Two interconnected upgrades. (1) `SKILL.md` gains Step 2b: before writing any HTML, Claude writes `findings.md` with a mandatory Evidence inventory table where every claim must name its data source — closing the main hallucination vector where approximate values replaced confirmed BQ query outputs. (2) `evaluator.md` is redesigned to diagnose *why* each gap occurred, not just *what* was missing: every gap now gets a failure mode tag backed by a grounded citation, and a new Section 4 table maps all gaps directly to actionable skill file edits.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c010 / c011)

- **Step 2b — Structured findings synthesis (c010):** Claude now writes `findings.md` before writing any HTML, with four required sections: Root cause (one sentence), Mechanism (causal chain), Timing (classification + evidence), Evidence inventory (Claim / Supporting data / Source / Confidence). Open items force explicit resolution — query, arithmetic, or explicit acceptance — before Step 3 begins. Step 3 writes from `findings.md` as source of truth, not from raw query outputs.
- **Evidence inventory Source column (c011):** Every claim must name its data origin: a specific `summary.json` field, a named BQ query result, or a specific report table row. A number with no named source must be derived explicitly or removed — it must not enter the report.
- **Output paths:** All paths use `<run_dir>` shorthand (`transcript.md`, `findings.md`, `report.html`, `evaluation.md`) consistent with the auto-increment run folder naming from c016.

**`evals/evaluator.md`** (e001)

- **What to review** — Added all four skill reference files (SKILL.md, hypothesis.md, context.md, report_structure.md) as the first pre-read step, before the report and transcript. Required so the evaluator can verify whether an instruction existed before classifying a gap.
- **Scoring** — Added two new required fields per theme: `Gap` (if score ≤ 4) describing specifically what was missing or wrong; `Why` — a failure mode tag with a grounding citation.
- **Failure Mode Classification** (new section) — Defines four tags with meanings and grounding requirements: `[MISSING_INSTRUCTION]`, `[AMBIGUOUS_INSTRUCTION]`, `[EXEC_ERROR]`, `[DATA_LIMIT]`. Tag assignment without a citation is explicitly prohibited.
- **Output format** — Section 2 updated with inline `Gap` / `Why` blocks. Section 4 added: Failure Mode Summary table mapping every gap to a specific file + fix description.
- **Self-honesty check** — Four grounding checks added (one per tag type): did you actually look in the skill files, quote the instruction, confirm an attempt in the transcript, verify data unavailability?

### Test runs

Two new runs added (`v1.5`):
- **ce189_2026-03-05_2026-05-03** (Vatican Museums) — 25/35. Dual-driver: S2C supply capacity pressure (spring demand exceeded fixed Vatican slot supply, confirmed via availability proxy and lead-time bucket query) + C2O iOS/Android device split (price shock + live inventory). First run evaluated against the evaluator v1.5 rubric.
- **ce6495_2026-03-05_2026-05-03** (Kualoa Ranch) — 24/35. S2C demand quality decline: spring break wind-down replaced high-intent vacationers with low-intent off-peak tourists. First run to conclusively establish seasonal demand quality as a mechanism (no supply, pricing, or UX change confirmed).

## [v1.6] — 2026-05-04 — Query fix, Geo/Non-Geo dimension, routing exit investigation, events reference

**Summary:** Four interconnected additions that sharpen the investigation's analytical depth. (1) A critical query correctness fix: cascade and L2+ queries now use `COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ...)` instead of `COUNTIF`, preventing rates > 1.0 on multi-experience sessions. (2) A new Geo vs Non-Geo dimension cut lets investigators distinguish domestic vs international traffic dynamics in high-local-demand markets. (3) The mix routing exit investigation is fully specified for all three cascade levels with a 3-tier path (time the shift → sub-segment → URL impact) and declaration templates. (4) A new `events.md` reference maps all GTM/Mixpanel events across LP, S2C, and C2O with properties, purpose, and exclusion notes.

### Changes by file

**`references/context.md`** (c012 / c013)

- **c012 — Query fix:** `COUNTIF` replaced with `COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_X THEN user_id END)` in cascade Level 2/3 queries and the canonical L2+ template. The funnel table fans out rows when a user views multiple experiences in one session, causing `COUNTIF` numerators to exceed `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` denominators and produce rates > 1.0. Also added missing `PERFORMANCE_MAX` exclusion filter to Level 2 and Level 3 cascade queries.
- **c012 — mix_effect / conversion_effect arithmetic guide:** Step-by-step formula (share_pre/post → Δshare/Δrate → mix_effect = Δshare × pre_rate, conversion_effect = pre_share × Δrate) plus a worked Level 3 example showing the full arithmetic and the fix declaration that follows.
- **c012 — Canonical L2+ query template:** Annotated reference query showing the fixed segment lines (`is_microbrand_page` and `channel_name` filters) that carry through all L2+ queries.
- **c013 — Geo vs Non-Geo dimension:** Pre-step to look up CE home country via `dim_experiences.country` (not `dim_combined_entities.country`, which can be NULL for sheet-only CEs). Country-level query with top-5 CTE + home country always included regardless of rank. Each row tagged `geo_segment` (Geo / Non-Geo / Unknown). Interpretation guide: Geo drop → local supply/pricing/campaign + cross-cut with local language; Non-Geo drop → international traffic quality/UX gap + cross-cut with experience_id.

**`references/hypothesis.md`**

- **Mix routing exit — fully specified (3 levels × 3 tiers):** Each of the three cascade exit levels now has a complete 3-tier investigation: Tier 1 time the shift (weekly volume query, anchor week), Tier 2 sub-segment cut (language/market within HO; channel within Paid; channel gain/loss within Paid), Tier 3 URL impact (page_url volumes for losing segment). Each level has a declaration template naming the shift week, sub-segment, affected URLs, and DRI.
- **LP2S first-pass branches:** Added `browsing_country` (Geo/Non-Geo) as a Tier 1 parallel cut. Geo concentration → cross-cut with local language. Non-Geo concentration → cross-cut with `experience_id`. Points to dedicated `context.md → "Geo vs Non-Geo"` query.
- **S2C first-pass branches:** Added `browsing_country` (Geo/Non-Geo) as a Tier 1 parallel cut. Geo S2C drop → local supply scarcity or pricing shock at variant selection. Non-Geo drop → language/UX friction or international inventory gaps.
- **C2O (C2A) — optional Geo/Non-Geo:** Added as an optional cut when C2A drop is broad with no device/experience concentration — spikes in specific countries can indicate currency display friction or payment method unavailability.

**`references/report_structure.md`**

- **Mix cascade analysis block:** New `analysis-block` spec for Section 3 — three sub-tables (one per cascade level), each showing Segment · Pre/Post users · Pre/Post share · Pre/Post CVR · Mix effect · Conv. effect · Verdict. Verdict line states overall outcome (conversion path or routing exit). `highlight-row` on the fixed segment row. If cascade exited at a mix level, render only levels up to and including the exit.

**`references/events.md`** (new file)

Running reference mapping GTM/Mixpanel events to funnel steps. LP: 15 structured events (Microsite Page Viewed through More Details Swipesheet Closed) + 4 unstructured. S2C: 14 structured (Select Page Viewed through gtm.scrollDepth) + 3 unstructured. C2O: 15 structured (Checkout Page Viewed through Order Completed) + 8 unstructured. Each event lists key properties to pull and analytical purpose. Includes session join key notes (`h-sid` on LP vs `HSID` on select/checkout), deduplication guidance for GTM multi-trigger events, and excluded noise event lists per funnel step.

## [v1.7] — 2026-05-06 — Inventory analysis overhaul (TID-level queries, Path A/B, supply gate)

**Summary:** The S2C inventory analysis methodology was comprehensively rewritten. The old `count_days_available_30d` proxy from `product_rankings_features` is removed entirely; all inventory investigation now uses direct TID-level queries against `inventory_availability`. Two query bugs were fixed first (CE-wide scope; sold-out overcounting). The rewrite introduces a structured 3-step path: locus identification via `lost_checkouts_delta`, a TID snapshot table (Step 2), and a daily time-series (Step 3). A Path A / Path B determination gate handles the 30-day rolling window limitation. A supply gate prevents unnecessary deep-dives when inventory is not depleted.

### Changes by file

**`references/context.md`** (c014 / c015)

- **c014 — Inventory query bug fixes:** Fixed two bugs in the existing lead-time bucket query. (1) CE-wide scope bug: the query fetched all `tour_id`s for the CE instead of filtering to the confirmed TGID (`experience_id = '<tgid>'`). (2) Sold-out overcounting: `COUNTIF(total_remaining = 0)` operated at TID × date grain — a date where one TID was sold out but others held capacity was incorrectly counted as zero-inventory. Fixed by adding a `tgid_daily_inventory` CTE that sums remaining across all TIDs per date before bucketing; a date is only zero-inventory when the sum across all TIDs is zero.
- **c015 — Inventory analysis complete rewrite:** Removed `count_days_available_30d` as the inventory signal across the entire inventory section. Restructured as a **3-step path**:
  - **Step 1 — Locus identification:** Compute `lost_checkouts_delta = users_select_post × (s2c_rate_pre − s2c_rate_post)` per TGID from Q4 results. Three cases: Case A (top TGID ≥60% of total delta → single locus), Case B (2–3 TGIDs each ≥10% → multiple loci, run Step 2 for each), Case C (no TGID ≥10% → uniform drop, broad-drop path: Step 2 for top 3 TGIDs by `users_select`).
  - **Step 2 — TID snapshot:** Run against latest `extracted_date`. One row per TID. Ticket counts (sum of `total_remaining`) in four buckets: 0–2d, 3–7d, 8–13d, 14–30d. `is_fully_unlimited_capacity` flag identifies TIDs where `total_remaining = 1` is a system constant — these must be excluded from scarcity analysis.
  - **Step 3 — Daily time-series:** `extracted_date` trend per bucket. Path B: pre+post overlaid. Path A: post only. Scope to single TID if one TID is the locus, or whole TGID if all TIDs depleted equally.
  - **Path A vs Path B:** Determined by `pre_start >= CURRENT_DATE - 30`. Path B = full pre/post comparison available. Path A = pre-period outside 30-day window; post-only snapshot with explicit data-limitation note.
  - **Supply gate:** If Step 2 shows no depletion across limited-capacity TIDs, do not run Step 3 — pivot to pricing or UX investigation instead.
  - **Broad-drop path (Case C):** Run Step 2 for top 3 TGIDs by `users_select`. Same bucket depleted across all three → CE-wide supply constraint. All full → supply is not the mechanism.

**`references/hypothesis.md`** (c016)

- All references to `count_days_available_30d` as the availability signal replaced with `inventory_availability` TID summary table (Step 2 results).
- **Gradual S2C decline (Pattern 4):** `days_to_first_available_date` added as a fast directional check before running inventory queries — increasing trend confirms supply scarcity direction.
- **CE-wide S2C drop (no concentration):** Updated to point to the broad-drop inventory path (top 3 TGIDs by volume, Step 2 for each).
- **Vendor throttling pattern:** Signal updated from `count_days_available_30d` to `days_to_first_available_date` increasing + 0–2d bucket near zero in TID snapshot.
- **S2C Tier 1 (experience concentrates):** Updated to reference `lost_checkouts_delta` locus computation → Case A/B/C → 3-step inventory path.

**`references/actions.md`** (c017)

- RC2 (Inventory/availability constraint): removed `count_days_available_30d` reference; replaced with `inventory_availability` TID summary table (near-zero ticket counts in one or more lead-time buckets) as primary signal.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c018)

- Inventory section format renamed (from "Inventory lead-time bucket table format").
- "What belongs in Section 3" table rows updated: "Availability proxy table" and "Inventory lead-time bucket table" replaced with "Inventory TID summary table" (Step 2) and "Inventory daily time-series charts" (Step 3).
- **Supply gate outcome:** if Step 2 finds no depleted limited-capacity TIDs, write a ruled-out callout and skip the table/charts entirely.
- **Path B spec:** one row per TID, Pre/Post column pairs per bucket, `Capacity type` column, `highlight-row` on TID rows where affected bucket pair shows material drop; unlimited-capacity TIDs excluded with subtext note.
- **Path A spec:** post-only columns, amber note stating pre-period unavailability.
- **Daily time-series spec:** four charts (one per bucket); Path B overlays pre/post; Path A post only.
- HTML pattern replaced: old format (rows per bucket, aggregate columns) replaced with separate Path A and Path B patterns.

**`references/q1_base.sql`** (c019)

- Removed `MAX(CASE WHEN page_type IN (...) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS visited_lp` from SELECT (condition already in WHERE clause). Fixed `GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 9` → `GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 8` to reflect the column count change.

**`references/worked_example.md`** (c020)

- Removed `count_days_available_30d` from the S2C locus identification section (Example 2). Added TID summary table query result showing `tickets_8_13d` and `tickets_14_30d` → 0 for all TIDs of TGID 8821, confirming the 8+ day window as the affected bucket.

### Test runs

Three new runs added (`v1.7`):
- **ce6495_2026-03-05_2026-05-03_run3** (Kualoa Ranch) — 31/35. Third run on the same CE/window; methodological improvements over run2: Geo/Non-Geo first-pass S2C cut correctly executed, TGID-scoped TID snapshot with corrected COUNTIF, Path A correctly applied. Confirms spring break demand quality decline with supply definitively ruled out (TGID 37530 fully stocked across all buckets).
- **ce234_2026-04-21_2026-05-04** (Empire State Building) — 27/35. Routing story: Google Ads traffic collapsed 58%, shifting paid/organic mix from 80/20 to 51/49. Product funnel intact (Google Ads CVR stable at 5.8%). Gaps: organic LP2S drop (26%→10%) not investigated, URL traffic comparison omitted, Level 2 cascade used all-traffic summary.json data instead of MB-filtered query.
- **ce144_2026-04-08_2026-05-05** (Alcatraz Tours) — 32/35. CVR improvement case: +3.78pp above prior year driven by April 15 launch of exp 36426 ($47.95 ferry+audio) displacing $87.30 self-guided tour. S2C +7.0pp, C2A +9.9pp. International markets benefited most. Only residual gap: A2O −2.24pp from increased international visitor share.

## [v1.8] — 2026-05-07 — context.md/hypothesis.md structural separation + presentation-layer jargon fixes

**Summary:** Two connected changes. First, investigation decision logic was moved out of `context.md` and into `hypothesis.md`, restoring the intended separation: `context.md` owns business vocabulary, table schemas, and SQL queries; `hypothesis.md` owns the investigation decision tree (when to run what, how to interpret results, which branches to open). Second, three presentation-layer bugs were fixed in `report_structure.md` — internal investigation terminology was leaking into HTML reports, and raw date tables were being used where Plotly charts are required.

### Changes by file

**`references/context.md`** (c019)

- **Structural separation:** Removed all investigation decision logic from the inventory section. What moved out: TGID locus identification (Case A/B/C + `lost_checkouts_delta` formula), the Path A/B decision framing, the TID scoping decision block, and the broad-drop path (Case C).
- **Queries renamed:** "Step 2 — TID summary table" → "TID snapshot query"; "Step 3 — Daily time-series" → "Daily time-series query". The numbered Step labels were investigation-layer jargon, not neutral query names.
- **Data availability rewritten as facts:** Path A/B information rewritten neutrally ("`inventory_availability` retains a 30-day rolling window — if `pre_start < CURRENT_DATE − 30`, no pre-period rows exist") without decision framing. The decision about what to do with this fact lives in `hypothesis.md`.
- **Pointer added:** "For TGID selection and the full inventory investigation decision sequence, see `hypothesis.md → S2C → inventory branch`."

**`references/hypothesis.md`** (c007)

- **"If experience concentrates" branch now owns the full inventory investigation sequence:** (1) TGID selection via `lost_checkouts_delta` + three-case classification (Case A ≥60% / Case B multiple ≥10% / Case C uniform drop); (2) data availability check before querying; (3) optional gradual-decline pre-check with `days_to_first_available_date`; (4) TID snapshot query usage (flag unlimited-capacity TIDs, scope the time-series); (5) daily time-series query usage — primary evidence, always run; (6) supply confirm/rule-out decision (healthy throughout post → pivot to pricing; depleted during post → supply is the mechanism).
- **Broad-drop path (Case C) moved here from `context.md`:** Top 3 TGIDs by `users_select`; same bucket depleted across all three → CE-wide supply constraint; all healthy → supply ruled out.
- **"Step 2/3" label references removed throughout** — queries referenced by their neutral names.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c012)

- **Supply gate wording:** Removed "Step 2" reference. Ruled-out verdict now framed in terms of what the time-series showed, not internal step labels. Clarified that Plotly line charts may still be shown in the supply-ruled-out case as positive confirmation (lines staying above zero is visual evidence).
- **Anti-pattern added — Investigation-internal terminology in HTML:** Step 1/2/3, Path A/B, Case A/B/C, "locus", "lost_checkouts_delta", "candidate TGIDs" must not appear anywhere in the report. In the report: "the three most-affected experiences" not "the Case B candidate TGIDs"; "supply checked and ruled out" not "Step 3 confirmed supply ruled out".
- **Anti-pattern added — Daily inventory as HTML table:** A 27-row × 4-column date table is unreadable at a glance. Daily inventory time-series must always be Plotly line charts, never HTML tables. The only table in the inventory section is the TID snapshot summary.

---

## [v1.9] — 2026-05-20 — URL breakdown query, S2C secondary-driver scoping, Section 3 ordering, action card quality gates

**Summary:** Five connected quality upgrades, most motivated by gaps identified in recent CE 2330 and CE 189 evaluations. A dedicated URL breakdown query (`pct_of_lp` CTE) is added to `context.md` and wired into `hypothesis.md` and `report_structure.md` — replacing the canonical L2+ query wherever URL routing vs performance disambiguation is needed. `hypothesis.md` gains a secondary-driver scoping block for S2C (prevents unnecessary first-pass branches when S2C is not the primary driver) and a C2O experience-routing follow-up sequence. `report_structure.md` gains a fixed Section 3 ordering, a URL-level breakdown HTML block, an action card evidence threshold rule, and multi-step "What broke?" examples. `actions.md` gains a DATA GAP template for the RC9 unresolved A2O mechanism case. `SKILL.md` gains two new findings-gate items: fixed-segment reflection check and action card data-accessibility check.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`**
- **Depth vs completeness clarification** — Added a note below the branch completeness rule: the rule is about map coverage, not depth. A one-line closure satisfies completeness without requiring a full investigation branch for every minor quantified signal.
- **Findings gate item 6 — Fixed segment reflected in analysis** — Verify that L2+ queries apply all fixed-segment filters declared in the mix cascade. If a broader cut was used as a proxy, note it explicitly and confirm it is a reasonable approximation.
- **Findings gate item 7 — Action cards reference accessible data** — Confirm that any data point cited in an action card is reachable via analytics. If it falls outside a rolling window or a backlogged table, name an alternative source so the DRI knows where to look.

**`references/context.md`** (c026)
- Added dedicated URL breakdown query with a `totals` CTE that computes `pct_of_lp` (each URL's share of CE LP traffic per period). Required to distinguish routing shifts from performance shifts. Carries all fixed segment filters; sorts by `users_lp DESC`.

**`references/hypothesis.md`** (c016, c017)
- **c016 — S2C secondary-driver scoping block** — When S2C is a secondary driver, run the fixed-segment aggregate first before opening first-pass branches. Two early-exit paths: flat/improved → RULED OUT; declined but directionally explained by primary finding → CONFIRMED with one-line note. Only open full branch set for an independent S2C decline.
- **C2O experience routing follow-up** — Two directional checks when C2O improved via an experience routing shift: pricing signal (`final_price_usd` pre/post) and availability signal (`days_to_first_available_date`). If neither explains the shift, flag as DATA GAP.
- **c017 — URL concentration pointer updated** — Now points to the dedicated URL breakdown query instead of the canonical L2+ query, since the section requires `pct_of_lp`.

**`references/actions.md`** (c004)
- **RC9 DATA GAP action template** — Template action card for when the A2O locus is confirmed but `order_attempted_events_v2` was not queried (backlogged). Provides BQ query scope and three sub-hypotheses: inventory sync failure, gateway decline, fraud over-blocking.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c021, c022, c023, c024)
- **c021** — Section 1c "What broke?" multi-step examples: when multiple funnel steps carry >15% Shapley share, name all in one sentence. Seasonal/event framing must be paired with a specific data signal.
- **c022** — Action card evidence threshold: rate drop + raw event count must both pass before creating a standalone card; directional small-sample signals get a sub-bullet inside an existing card.
- **c023** — Section 3 fixed ordering: 8 always-present blocks numbered in sequence (mix cascade → Geo/Non-Geo → Shapley → daily trend → primary driver cuts → secondary driver evidence → ruled-out dimensions → hypotheses explored).
- **c024** — URL-level breakdown block HTML pattern: two verdict forms (performance vs routing), table with `% of LP` column, `.highlight-row` rules, pointer to dedicated URL query.

### Test runs

Three new runs added (`v1.9`):
- **ce189_2026-04-09_2026-05-06** (Vatican Museums) — 31/35. Post-Easter seasonal composition shift confirmed as root cause; supply definitively ruled out (both limited-capacity TIDs show zero tickets in both pre and post periods). Remaining gaps: daily trend charts not filtered to fixed segment; no controlled comparison excluding Italian national holidays.
- **ce2330_2026-03-13_2026-05-12_run2** (Walt Disney World Orlando) — 28/35. Dual-driver: spring break → off-season demand shift (primary) + Magic Kingdom A2O failure for experience 36344 (secondary, DATA GAP pending order_attempted_events_v2). Run 2 closes all three execution errors from Run 1. Remaining gaps: Fixed Segment banner not rendered as standalone HTML component; cross-cut (Android Mweb × experience × A2O) not run.
- **ce6495_2026-03-13_2026-05-12** (Kualoa Ranch) — 27/35. Near-term inventory depletion of UTV Raptor Tour (TID 80074) confirmed as root cause via Jurassic Zipline inverse confirmation. Main gap: C2O branch not opened despite 22% Shapley share.

---

## [v1.10] — 2026-05-21 — Parallel first-pass batch, cross-cut investigation, inventory/completeness improvements

**Summary:** Three sets of changes bundled together. (1) First-pass branch set now runs via parallel sub-agents — each sub-agent receives only the SQL, an output path, and an explicit output contract (no reference files), enforcing context isolation. Main agent writes all SQL before spawning, waits for the full batch, then synthesises from the combined picture. Batch JSONs saved to `<run_dir>/batch_<cut_name>.json`. (2) Cross-cut added as a first-class investigation step with a formal trigger rule (≥8pp absolute or ≥20% relative), enumerated cross-cuts by funnel step, and a generic 2-dimension query template in `context.md`. (3) Inventory queries overhauled: period-median queries (APPROX_QUANTILES) replace single-date snapshots, bridge table fixed to `dim_experience_management WHERE variant_status = 'Active'`, time-series interpretation rewritten with trend-based classification, multi-TGID verdict patterns added to `report_structure.md`. Investigation completeness rules tightened across SKILL.md c022–c027.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c027)
- "Run all branches within a level in parallel" replaced with a five-step spawning protocol. Each sub-agent receives exactly: complete SQL, output path (`<run_dir>/batch_<cut_name>.json`), and output contract. No reference files passed — context isolation enforced. Main agent waits for all results before synthesising. Transcript section opened before spawning, results filled after batch completes. Failure handling: missing JSON = DATA PULL FAILURE, log and continue, do not re-query inline. Applies to first-pass branch set only; deeper levels remain sequential.

**`references/context.md`**
- Cross-cut query template: generic 2-dimension query, funnel step substitution table, worked A2O example (`device_type × experience_id`).
- Inventory period-median queries (APPROX_QUANTILES across all extracted_dates in window) replace single-date snapshots.
- Bridge table fixed from `dim_tours` to `dim_experience_management WHERE variant_status = 'Active'`.
- Time-series interpretation guide rewritten: trend-based classification (sustained depression, onset event, gradual decline, episodic dips). Artifact detection rule for synchronised zeros.

**`references/hypothesis.md`**
- Cross-cut section: trigger rule (≥8pp absolute or ≥20% relative), common cross-cuts by funnel step (A2O, S2C, LP2S, C2A), three-outcome interpretation guide.
- TGID selection simplified to judgment-based language (removed rigid Case A/B/C).
- TID scoping rule: single depleted TID → individual scope; multiple depleted → TGID aggregate; mixed → depleted only.
- Inventory jargon firewall note added before inventory sequence.

---

## [v1.11] — 2026-05-21 — Slack context layer

**Summary:** Added Slack context layer to the investigation. A fire-and-forget sub-agent is spawned at the top of Step 2 (after `summary.json` is read, before the data-driven investigation starts) and runs three searches: CE-specific global (pre_start − 14 days → post_end), market channel read (pre_start → post_end), and #tf-bugalert (post_start − 2 days → post_end). Output written to `<run_dir>/slack_context.md` in four buckets: Platform/Bug, Supply/Inventory, Campaign/Traffic, CE-specific mentions. The main agent never waits for it — Slack is consulted only at Step 2b. Step 2b gains check #9 (Slack context reconciliation) with corroborate / test gap / reject classification. `report_structure.md` gains optional 5th "Source" column in hypotheses explored table and inline citation format. Sub-agent instruction set lives in `references/slack_context_guide.md`.

---

## [v1.12] — 2026-05-22 — Bidirectional RCA support, four-pattern Slack reconciliation, link-to-table styling, jargon preservation

**Summary:** Largest skill release since v1.0. Three connected expansions land together. **(1) Bidirectional RCA support** — the skill now treats CVR improvements as first-class investigations alongside declines. New "Improvement direction" first-pass branch sets in `hypothesis.md`. New bidirectional Pattern 11 (Catalogue change — TGID launch, disablement, restructure). New "Improvement direction — action templates" library in `actions.md` with Protect / Extend / Investigate-headwind sub-templates. Report-structure spec gains improvement-case headwind magnitude threshold, sign-aware Shapley flex bar, and direction-aware scoring guidance in the evaluator. **(2) Four-pattern Slack reconciliation model** — Step 2b check #9 rewritten. Every signal classifies into Pattern A (direct corroboration), B (mechanism explanation), C (reframing context), D (testable gap), or Reject. Each pattern routes to a specific surface in the report. Mandatory timeframe-citation rule and one-citation-per-concept rule. Slack consulted only at Step 2b — fire-and-forget pattern is deliberate. **(3) Link-to-table styling + jargon preservation** — every Section 3 analysis block carries an `id` attribute with canonical anchor IDs. New `.ref-link` CSS (↗ icon, smooth scroll, `:target` highlight). New styling rule 5: preserve Headout-native jargon (WBR, SP, GBV, TGID, TID, MB/HO, LP2S, S2C, C2O, etc.). **(4) Step 4 footer hardened** — two output lines only. **(5) Same-period vs different-period data boundary** documented in `context.md`.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c029)
- Step 2b check #9 rewritten with four-pattern classification (A/B/C/D) + Reject.
- Pattern A on declines: citation-elevation rule for DRI-bound actions.
- Step 4 footer hardened — two output lines are the only chat output.
- Session recordings rule extended to improvement loci.
- L2+ section gains direction-sensitive language and pointer to improvement-direction branches.
- Catalogue change called out as a first-class data-driven hypothesis.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c025)
- New "Slack integration & link-to-table styling" section: three-layer model, four-pattern cross-reference table, timeframe-citation rule, ↗ link-to-table pattern.
- New Styling rule 5: preserve Headout-native jargon.
- Section 2 gains improvement-direction action card sub-spec (Protect / Extend / Investigate-headwind).
- Section 3 ordering adds item 6.5 Market Context (conditional).
- New "Market context & operational signals" HTML block spec.
- Shapley block gains sign-aware flex bar rule.
- Visual Spec gains `.ref-link` CSS, scroll-behavior, `.analysis-block:target` highlight.
- New "Anchor ID convention" section.

**`references/hypothesis.md`** (c018)
- Cross-cut trigger rule rephrased to "concentrated movement (in either direction)."
- New "Improvement direction — first-pass branches" section.
- New "Pattern 11: Catalogue change (bidirectional)."
- New "Slack signal classification" reference table.

**`references/context.md`** (c027)
- New "Catalogue change" query section with `dim_experience_management` scan and `product_rankings_features` fallback.
- New "Same-period vs different-period external metrics" section.

**`references/actions.md`** (c005)
- New Root Cause 11: Catalogue change.
- New "Improvement direction — action templates" library: Protect, Extend, Investigate-headwind.
- New "Slack-corroboration upgrade on decline actions" rule.

**`evals/evaluator.md`**
- New "Direction-aware scoring note" for improvement RCAs.
- Theme 3 gains structural-delta-based depth calibration.

**`templates/report.html`**
- `.ref-link` CSS, `scroll-behavior: smooth`, `.analysis-block:target` highlight added.

### Test runs

Two new runs added (`v1.12`):
- **ce1223_2026-03-22_2026-05-20** (Pompeii Tickets & Tours) — 26/35. CVR improvement case (+0.51pp): broad-based C2O lift in MB · Paid · Google Ads, half seasonal / half structural, Italy domestic volume as the engine. Gaps: structural driver (exp 25518 launch timing) not investigated; session recordings not pulled despite locus confirmed on exp 8869.
- **ce3593_2026-03-22_2026-05-20** (Antelope Canyon) — 32/35. Headline CVR flat (−0.08pp) masking −12.6% order shortfall. kens-tours subdomain Google Ads campaign paused on May 7, 2026 — 2,699 lost high-CVR (~11%) users, 294 forgone orders. Data-derived finding matched the documented mitigation cause (Ken's Tours legal Cease & Desist) to the day. Gap: session recordings not pulled.

---

## [v1.13] — 2026-05-22 — Perf-audit companion-skill integration (plug-and-play sub-agent)

**Summary:** CVR-RCA gains a paid-traffic enrichment layer by spawning a separate companion skill — `perf-audit-skill` — as a background sub-agent whenever the L1 cascade fixes on Paid. Mirrors the Slack fire-and-forget pattern exactly: spawn at the end of the cascade, do not consult during L2+ dimension cuts, read the verdict only at Step 2b synthesis. Two skills stay independent — no schemas, queries, or diagnostic logic moved between them. The sub-agent runs the full perf-audit on the CVR-RCA's pre/post date windows and writes a structured summary (overall verdict, SIS / CPC / Paid CVR trends, campaign status, one-sentence key finding, optional surprise hypothesis) to `<run_dir>/perf_audit_summary.md`. Step 2b gains check #10 reconciling the verdict using the same four-pattern model as Slack (A/B/C/D + Reject). Funnel data is deliberately excluded from the summary to avoid attribution conflicts. CVR-RCA runs fully without it — if path resolution fails, the run logs `Perf-audit skill not installed — skipped` and continues.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c030)
- New section "Perf-audit context — fire and forget (Paid-side only)" inserted at end of L1 cascade. Trigger conditions, skip conditions, four-step path resolution, spawn block, context-isolation note.
- Step 2b gains check #10 "Perf-audit reconciliation" with four-pattern routing (A/B/C/D) + Reject + DATA GAP handling.
- Root cause callout requirement: Patterns A, B, C must reflect the perf-audit verdict in the final report.

**`references/hypothesis.md`** (c030)
- LP2S first-pass branches gain a "Paid fixed segment — perf-audit background context" paragraph.
- Mix first-pass branches gain a "Perf-audit background context (Level 2 and Level 3 exits)" paragraph.

**`INSTALL.md`** (c030)
- New optional Step 5 "Install the perf-audit companion skill" with detect-existing-install logic.

---

## [v1.14] — 2026-05-23 — Tabbed report framework (single deliverable for C-level audits)

**Summary:** The CVR-RCA report becomes a multi-tab HTML deliverable. The first tab is the existing CVR-RCA report (unchanged). When the perf-audit sub-agent ran (cascade fixed on Paid), a second tab — **Paid Performance Audit** — is rendered inline from `perf_audit_report.md` so stakeholders can read the full perf-audit without opening a separate file. Cross-tab citations work natively: every `(per perf-audit ↗)` style reference inside the CVR-RCA tab deep-links into the right perf-audit section. The framework is scalable by design — adding a future third tab is a one-line config entry. Backward compatibility is absolute: any run where the perf-audit didn't fire produces the existing flat report, byte-identical to v1.13 output.

### Changes by file

**`scripts/render.py`** (c031)
- New stdlib-only markdown-to-HTML renderer (~150 lines): ATX headings, GFM tables, lists, bold/italic/code/links, horizontal rules, HTML comment passthrough.
- New `render_markdown_tab(path, anchor_prefix)` — reads markdown, renders to HTML, wraps in `<div class="md-content">`. Graceful fallback to placeholder if file missing.
- New `render_tab_bar(tabs)` — emits sticky `<div class="tab-bar">` above panes; only called when `tabs[]` length ≥ 2.
- `assemble()` extended to accept new `tabs[]` spec shape. With ≥2 tabs, tab bar + panes emitted; with 1 tab / no `tabs[]` key, renders flat (legacy path).

**`templates/report.html`** (c031)
- Sticky `.tab-bar` with pill-style `.tab-button` (dark theme, blue accent for active tab).
- `.md-content` typography matching CVR-RCA tab look.
- ~50-line vanilla-JS handler: click handlers, delegated anchor handler switching tabs on cross-tab links, hash-on-load tab activation, Plotly `Plots.resize` for charts in newly-visible panes.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c026)
- New "Tabbed report structure" section: when tabs appear vs flat layout, full spec shape, per-tab keys, cross-tab anchor scheme, citation routing table, four-pattern citation phrasings, conditional-tab logic.

**`SKILL.md`** (c031)
- Step 3 instruction: inspect `<run_dir>/perf_audit_report.md`; if present and non-empty (and verdict not `DATA GAP: no campaigns`), write multi-tab spec; otherwise write legacy flat spec.

### Test runs

Two new runs added (`v1.14`):
- **ce252_2026-03-28_2026-05-26** (Louvre Museum Tickets) — 26/35. CVR improved +0.72pp (+1.69pp structural). S2C and C2O lifted on dominant TGID 3909 (same/next-day availability improved, days_to_first 1→0). France domestic +61% volume on seasonal ramp. LP2S headwind from Organic collapse reducing paid share. First run with tabbed report (CVR-RCA + Paid Performance Audit tabs).
- **ce243_2026-03-29_2026-05-27** (Eiffel Tower Tickets) — 30/35. CVR declined −0.18pp (−0.32pp structural). S2C fell −1.45pp on MB · Paid · Google Ads (69% Shapley share), concentrated on Desktop visitors browsing TGID 23604. Non-Geo Desktop −3.6pp, Geo Desktop −8.9pp; all mobile cells flat. Gradual onset from ~May 14. Supply, pricing, and catalogue all healthy — Desktop select-page abandonment mechanism not yet confirmed from available data.

---

## [v1.15] — 2026-05-29 — Left-aligned tabs + escape-hatch components (superseded same day by v1.16)

**Summary:** Shipped briefly before a quality-regression review on CE 243 triggered v1.16. The tab bar was moved to full-viewport-width with left-anchored buttons. Two escape-hatch components (`analysis_block`, `raw_html`) were added to `render.py` so novel findings could bypass the 19-component dispatcher. A slash-command preamble contradiction was fixed. All three changes were superseded or absorbed by v1.16: the tab placement survives as an HTML pattern; the escape hatches were retired with the pipeline; the slash-command correction partially reverted to the Claude-writes-HTML workflow.

---

## [v1.16] — 2026-05-29 — Retire spec-JSON + render.py pipeline; restore Claude-writes-HTML

**Summary:** v1.14–v1.15's `report_spec.json` + `scripts/render.py` rendering pipeline is retired for CVR-RCA content. Root cause: the 19 built-in component renderers shipped inline-styled HTML from pre-v1.13, creating a visual-era mismatch when mixed with escape-hatch blocks. CE 243 (Eiffel Tower, first pipeline-rendered production report) showed the drift against CE 252 (Louvre, hand-authored, quality target). The pipeline is replaced with Claude-writes-HTML directly following `report_structure.md` patterns — the same workflow that produced v1.13-era quality. The tab framework survives as a copy-pasteable HTML pattern in `report_structure.md`; perf-audit markdown is rendered inline at Step 3. Freedom of movement is total: no component dispatcher, no spec JSON, no rendering pipeline.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c033)
- Step 3 rewritten: "Write `report.html` directly, follow `report_structure.md` exactly." Spec-JSON and render.py instructions removed.
- Tab framework: binary decision (two-tab if perf-audit ran, single-tab flat otherwise) with HTML pattern pointers.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c029)
- "Tabbed report structure" spec shape rewritten as a copy-pasteable HTML pattern.
- New "Perf-audit tab rendering — markdown → HTML inline" subsection.
- Section 3 escape-hatch rows replaced with a single "Custom analysis block" row.

---

## [v1.17] — 2026-05-29 — Lazy-load references by phase

**Summary:** Claude no longer reads all four reference files upfront. Reading is deferred to the phase that needs the file: `context.md` + `hypothesis.md` at Step 2 (investigation), `actions.md` + `report_structure.md` at Step 3 (writing), `evals/evaluator.md` at Step 4. Files are loaded whole when loaded — section-level reads are explicitly rejected to preserve the cross-pattern reasoning surface. A new "On reading references — a note on freedom" subsection codifies the operating principle. `actions.md` is deferred to Step 3 so Step 2b synthesis reaches the root cause without action-template bias.

### Changes by file

**`SKILL.md`** (c034)
- "Before you begin" rewritten — reference reads moved to per-phase opening instructions. New "Per-phase reads" table.
- New "On reading references — a note on freedom" subsection.
- Step 2 opening: read `context.md` + `hypothesis.md` now, both fully.
- Step 3 opening: read `actions.md` + `report_structure.md` now, both fully.

### Test runs

One new run added (`v1.17`):
- **ce3593_2025-01-01_2026-05-27** (Antelope Canyon) — 28/35. YoY CVR improvement +1.22pp (+24.8%) with +72.6% LP volume growth. Multi-causal: (1) six new vendor-specific subdomain microsites launched in 2026 (kens-tours at 11.09% CVR on 22k users); (2) CE-wide A2O +5.53pp and C2A +5.66pp on fixed segment, consistent with platform-level infrastructure fix; (3) catalogue maturation — new TGIDs, 3–5× review count growth. First run under v1.17 lazy-load.

## [v1.18] — 2026-05-29 — Bulleted shape for Section 1 callout

**Summary:** Section 1 callout answers gain a second shape — lead claim + bullet list — for multi-mechanism findings. The existing paragraph form remains the default for single-mechanism findings. New styling rule 7: prefer the bullet shape when a callout enumerates drivers. The bullet form is documented in the Visual Spec with its own CSS and HTML pattern.

### Changes by file

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c030)
- New styling rule 7: prefer bullet shape when enumerating drivers.
- Section 1c spec documents both shapes (paragraph + lead claim with bullet list).
- Visual Spec gains CSS for `.callout-item .a ul`, `li`, `li strong` and a "Shape B — multi-driver" HTML pattern.

## [v1.19] — 2026-05-29 — Visual kit extraction + perf-audit HTML output + Tab 2 embed-from-HTML

**Summary:** Skill-agnostic visual primitives extracted from `report_structure.md` into a new shared file `references/visual_kit.md` — CSS, HTML patterns for metric cards / callouts / action cards / analysis blocks / tables / tab framework / Slack integration / styling rules / Plotly conventions. `report_structure.md` trimmed to CVR-RCA-specific structure only. Perf-audit now emits both `perf_audit_report.md` (text record) and `perf_audit_report.html` (polished standalone HTML). CVR-RCA's Tab 2 rendering switches from markdown→HTML conversion to byte-paste of perf-audit's HTML body — quality goes up, Claude's reading load goes down.

### Changes by file

**`references/visual_kit.md`** — NEW file (c001)
- Skill-agnostic visual primitives: shared `<style>` block, page skeleton, metric cards, callout HTML, action cards, analysis blocks, tables, Plotly conventions, anchor IDs, styling rules 1–7, Slack integration, tab framework, anti-patterns.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c031)
- Trimmed to CVR-RCA-specific content. Removed all generic visual primitives (moved to `visual_kit.md`).
- Added preamble pointing to `visual_kit.md`.

**`SKILL.md`** (c035)
- File-role descriptions updated: `visual_kit.md` added as "shared visual primitives."
- Step 3 Tab 2 rendering: read `perf_audit_report.html`, extract body, paste verbatim.

## [v1.20] — 2026-05-29 — Header dashboards row (Omni + Sentra)

**Summary:** Every CVR-RCA report header now carries a `.dashboards` row with two pill-button links — Omni Analytics and Sentra — with the CE filter pre-applied. The chrome lives in `visual_kit.md`; the URL templates live in `report_structure.md`. Only the CE ID is substituted at write time. Rendered unconditionally on every report.

### Changes by file

**`references/visual_kit.md`** (c002)
- Header CSS gains three rules for the `.dashboards` pill-button row.
- Page skeleton gains `<div class="dashboards">` placeholder inside `<header>`.

**`references/report_structure.md`** (c032)
- New "Header — CVR-RCA-specific extensions" section with Omni + Sentra URL templates and substitution rules.
- Pre-write sanity check gains a third item: dashboards row must be populated.

## [v1.21] — 2026-05-29 — Back-to-top floating arrow

**Summary:** A small UX addition. Every report now carries a fixed circular ↑ button in the bottom-right corner; one click scrolls smoothly back to the top of the page. Always visible (no scroll-detection JS to fade in/out), uses the existing `scroll-behavior: smooth` CSS via an anchor link to `<header id="top">` — zero new JavaScript. Hidden on print. Lives entirely in `visual_kit.md` because the chrome is skill-agnostic; any future skill emitting an HTML report inherits it.

### Changes by file

**`references/visual_kit.md`** (c003)
- New `.back-to-top` CSS rule: `position: fixed; bottom: 24px; right: 24px;` — 40×40px circular dark-navy translucent button with subtle box-shadow, hover-brightens and lifts 2px.
- `@media print { .back-to-top { display: none; } }` so it doesn't appear in printed/PDF exports.
- Page skeleton example: `<header>` gains `id="top"` as the anchor target; new `<a href="#top" class="back-to-top">↑</a>` placed near the end of `<body>` after `<footer>`.

### What did not change

- No new JavaScript — the existing `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }` rule handles the scroll animation.
- No interference with the tab-framework JS — that handler only acts when the anchor target is inside a non-active tab pane; `<header id="top">` is outside any tab pane, so the handler delegates to native browser behavior.
- No changes to `report_structure.md`, `SKILL.md`, or any per-skill structure file. Pure visual_kit chrome addition.
